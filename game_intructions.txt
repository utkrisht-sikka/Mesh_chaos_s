Instructions of game
 
Player has to reach the goal position from the start position, collecting all the randomly spawned rewards and avoiding obstacles. 
 ● The grid is of size n X n. :enter the value of n in the beginning of game. The start and goal positions are randomly placed 
 ● There are obstacles in some of the cells of the grid.
 ● The player can make moves like up, down, left and right and 2 special moves - rotate clockwise and rotate anticlockwise. The moves are case insensitive.
 ● A move is taken as input from the player. For instance, R4D3L2U1 means move 4 units to the right, then 3 units down, then 2 units to the left and finally 1 unit upwards.
 (The input need not necessarily contain all R, L, U and D. For example, R4D3 is also a valid input). Player has to give these inputs until it loses all its energy or reaches 
 the goal position. 
● The special moves (rotate anti/clockwise) are also taken as input from the player. If the input is A3, it means rotate the grid anti-clockwise 3 times. Similarly, C3 means
 3 times clockwise rotation. All rotations are by 90o. Note that when grid is rotated, the coordinates of the player and goal do not change; only the grid cells get rotated.
 Every rotation command reduces the player’s energy by n//3 units. 
● The score at the start is basically the energy of the player. The initial value of the energy is 2n units. Every time, the player consumes food, the player’s energy increases
 by value times n units where each food has its own value and every time it hits an obstacle it loses 4n units.
 ● Also, for every move, it loses 1 unit of energy (Energy lost for R4D3L2U1 is 4+3+2+1 = 10 units).  
● If the player is at the boundary and it makes a move which can take it out of the boundary, then the player will appear at the opposite side of the grid. For instance, if
 it is at the left boundary and it moves left, so it will appear at the right side of the grid on the same row.
